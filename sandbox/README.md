# Sandbox

Working projects to run vump against by hand, one per ecosystem and per shape.
They are real: the npm lock files came from `npm install`, the C# projects from
`dotnet new`, and each prints its own version when run. Reading them shows what
a `vump.toml` looks like for that ecosystem; running vump in them shows what a
bump actually rewrites.

This is not test coverage. The suite in `tests/` and the fixtures in
`src/domain/testdata/` prove correctness. These exist to be looked at.

| Path | Shows |
| --- | --- |
| [`npm/single-project`](npm/single-project) | One package, manifest and lock moving together |
| [`npm/multi-project`](npm/multi-project) | Two packages released independently, with per-project tags |
| [`cs/single-project`](cs/single-project) | `<Version>` in a `.csproj`, and what stays put around it |
| [`cs/multi-project`](cs/multi-project) | Two C# projects versioned independently |

## Git is off, deliberately

These projects have no repository of their own — they sit inside vump's. A
commit or tag made here lands in **this** repository, so every `vump.toml` in
the sandbox sets `through = "none"`.

Two further layers stand behind that setting, because it can be overridden by
a flag. vump refuses to **write** from a configuration nested inside another's
repository unless `--allow-nested` is passed — which is why every bump below
carries it. Reading is free: `status` and `check` need nothing. And each
project names its own tag and commit so that one made in spite of all that
still cannot be mistaken for vump's: `sandbox-npm-v1.2.3` rather than
`v1.2.3`. The release workflow triggers on tags matching `v*`, and nothing
from here may match it.

Typing `--allow-nested` on every bump here is the intended cost. These projects
are the one place the nested layout is kept deliberately, and the flag is a
standing reminder that anywhere else the answer is `[[project]]`.

That leaves nothing untested. Commits, tags and pushes are covered by the
end-to-end suite, which creates a throwaway repository per test and asserts on
what git actually built. The sandbox covers the half those tests do not show a
human: the file rewrites.

If you do want to watch the git side by hand, clone into a scratch directory
first and let the tags die with it:

```bash
git clone . /tmp/vump-scratch && cd /tmp/vump-scratch/sandbox/npm/single-project
```

Without that clone, `--allow-nested` is what lets a bump run at all, and adding
`--through tag` to it grows this repository's history by a commit and a
sandbox-prefixed tag.

## Trying it

```bash
cd sandbox/npm/single-project
vump status                            # what is recorded now
vump minor --dry-run --allow-nested    # what a bump would rewrite
vump minor --allow-nested              # rewrite it
node index.js               # the new version, from the manifest
```

The multi-project directories address their projects by name, and a tag
identifies its own project:

```bash
cd sandbox/npm/multi-project
vump status                               # every project at a glance
vump patch --project project-a --allow-nested
vump check sandbox-npm-project-a-v1.0.1   # the tag says which project to verify
```

For C#, the version reaches the assembly:

```bash
cd sandbox/cs/single-project
vump alpha --from minor --allow-nested
dotnet run --project Demo            # Demo 1.1.0-alpha.0
```

## Putting it back

Experiments are meant to be thrown away:

```bash
git checkout -- sandbox
```
